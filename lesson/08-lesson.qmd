Like the previous session, there isn't really a lesson today. You're not learning how to use any new functionsâ€”you're learning how to apply the geoms you already know in cool and exciting ways. But don't worry! You'll have a lesson for session 9!

For the lesson, [read through the code examples in the example](/example/08-example.qmd) to see how to make small multiples, sparklines, geofacets, and slopegraphs.
