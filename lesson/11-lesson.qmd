Once again, there's no lesson this time. You're all understanding the basics of R and {ggplot2} and {dplyr} *really well* (I'm seriously so impressed and proud of you all!).

In your exercise today you'll visualize trends in time using one of three different real-world datasets. [In the example](/example/11-example.qmd) I demonstrate how to remove seasonality from time series data, which is a useful skill, but *not always applicable* to every time series dataset. If there's no seasonality in your data, you don't need to remove it.

So head over to [the example](/example/11-example.qmd) or [the exercise](/assignment/11-exercise.qmd) to get started!
