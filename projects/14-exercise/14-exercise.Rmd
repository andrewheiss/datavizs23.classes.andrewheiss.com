# Task 1: Reflection

Put your reflection here


# Task 2: Enhanced plot

When you knit this document, you will create and save a basic bar chart of hot dog eating contest winners. You will then open the resulting file in Illustrator or Gravit Designer. Open the PDF in Illustrator; open the SVG in Gravit Designer.

Be sure that you save your file in Illustrator or Gravit Designer **with a different name**. You don't want to accidentally overwrite all your enhancements and updates when you knit this document. That would be so sad.

```{r make-and-save-hot-dog-plot}
library(tidyverse)
library(svglite)

hotdogs <- read_csv("data/hot-dog-contest-winners.csv") %>%
  rename(dogs = `Dogs eaten`, record = `New record`) %>%
  mutate(record = factor(record))

# Change the colors here if you want
# (or anything else if you want too)
plot_hotdogs <- ggplot(hotdogs, 
                       aes(x = Year, y = dogs, fill = record)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey80", "#FC7300")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1980, 2010, 2), 
                     expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 70, 10), 
                     expand = c(0, 0)) +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  labs(y = "Hot dogs and buns", x = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = NA),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = NA),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(size = 0.25),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(size = 0.5, linetype = "dashed"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

# Change the dimensions here if you want
ggsave(plot_hotdogs, filename = "hotdogs.pdf", device = cairo_pdf,
       width = 7, height = 4, units = "in", bg = "transparent")

ggsave(plot_hotdogs, filename = "hotdogs.svg",
       width = 7, height = 4, units = "in", bg = "transparent")
```
