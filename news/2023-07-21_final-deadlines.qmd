Hi everyone!

Remember [from the syllabus](/syllabus.qmd#late-work) that there aren't really any official deadlines:

> With the exception of the mini projects and the final project, **there’s no penalty for late work**. There’s no such thing as late work. I would **highly recommend** staying caught up as much as possible, but if you need to turn something in late, that’s fine—there’s **no penalty**. I might not be able to give you good feedback if you turn something in late, but that’s really the only practical penalty—there’s no harm to your grade.

**Two deadlines do matter though:**

1. Everything except the final project needs to be turned in by **11:59 PM on Wednesday, July 26** (that's the day after the last day of classes)
2. The final project has to be submitted by **11:59 PM on Sunday, July 30** (I have to submit grades shortly thereafter)
