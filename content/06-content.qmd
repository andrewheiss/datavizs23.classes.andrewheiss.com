### Possible questions to reflect on

::: {.callout-warning}
#### This is not a required list!

Remember, you don't need to answer all of these—or even any of them! These are just here to help guide your thinking. **Write about whatever you want.**
:::

- Why is it important to deal with uncertainty in data?
- What was good or bad about the New York Times' 2016 live election guage?
- Why is it so hard to visualize uncertainty?
- Why is it so hard to communicate uncertainty to others?
