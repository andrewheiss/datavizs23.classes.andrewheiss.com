### Possible questions to reflect on

::: {.callout-warning}
#### This is not a required list!

Remember, you don't need to answer all of these—or even any of them! These are just here to help guide your thinking. **Write about whatever you want.**
:::

- How can you know if a map projection is truthful or misleading?
- What's wrong (or not wrong) with using points on maps? Choropleths? Lines?

## Other resources

If you want to understand how the magic `geometry` column actually works, check out [this fantastic post](https://www.jessesadler.com/post/simple-feature-objects/).

Check out [this post where someone used {ggplot2} and {sf} to create fancy city map-based art that she printed for a friend](https://www.katiejolly.io/blog/2019-01-21/map-cutouts). You can do similar things after this session!

In addition to the example for this session, you can [check out this tutorial on using the {sf} package to create maps](https://r-spatial.org//r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.html). It shows how to include fancy map stuff like a north arrow and scale bar. 


## Slides

The slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
slide_buttons("/slides/12-slides")

xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  "/slides/12-slides.html",
  ratio = "16:9",
  border = "none",
  margin = "0 auto"
)
```

:::{.callout-tip}
**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.
