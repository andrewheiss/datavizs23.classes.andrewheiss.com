### Questions to reflect on

*(Remember, you don't need to answer all of theseâ€”or even any of them! These are just here to help guide your thinking.)*

- How do we know what is true?
- Are facts truth?
- Why do we visualize data?
- What makes a great visualization?
- How do you choose which kind of visualization to use?
