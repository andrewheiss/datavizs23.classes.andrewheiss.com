- Browse through recent visualizations at [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) ([like this one!](https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/)), [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/), [Christopher Ingraham's articles at the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/christopher-ingraham/?utm_term=.3bfc09eea703), [WSJ Graphics](https://graphics.wsj.com/), and the [New York Times's TheUpshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot). Most (if not all) of these graphics were made in R (or something similar) and exported for enhancement in Illustrator or [D3](https://d3js.org/).
