### Possible questions to reflect on

::: {.callout-warning}
#### This is not a required list!

Remember, you don't need to answer all of these—or even any of them! These are just here to help guide your thinking. **Write about whatever you want.**
:::

- Why is qualitative data difficult to visualize?
- Why are word clouds so problematic? When is (not) okay to use them?
