### Possible questions to reflect on

::: {.callout-warning}
#### This is not a required list!

Remember, you don't need to answer all of these—or even any of them! These are just here to help guide your thinking. **Write about whatever you want.**
:::

- Why is it important to visualize variables and data?
- What does it mean to map data to graph aesthetics?
- What data was mapped to which aesthetics in Rosling's video?

## Other resources

[This tutorial by Cédric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/) is an excellent demonstration of the grammar of graphics and the sequential nature of building up a plot layer-by-layer.


## Slides

The slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
slide_buttons("/slides/03-slides")

xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  "/slides/03-slides.html",
  ratio = "16:9",
  border = "none",
  margin = "0 auto"
)
```

**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.
