title: Readings, lectures, and videos
---

Each class session has a set of required readings that you should complete ***before*** watching the lecture or working through the lesson. 

I've included a set of questions that might guide your reflection response. **You should not try to respond to all of these** (or any of them if you don't want to)—they'll just help you know what to look for and think about as you read.

Every class session also has a YouTube playlist of short recorded videos for each of the lecture sections. The lecture slides are special HTML files made with the R package [{xaringan}](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html) (R can do so much!). On each class session page you'll buttons for opening the presentation in a new tab or for downloading a PDF of the slides in case you want to print them or store them on your computer:

<p class="buttons" style="text-align:center;"><span class="btn btn-danger">{{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} View all slides in new window</span> <span class="btn btn-danger">{{< fa file-pdf >}} Download PDF of all slides</span></p>

The slides are also embedded on each page. You can click in the slides and navigate through them with <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd>. If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while viewing the slides you can see a list of slide-specific commands (like <kbd>f</kbd> for fullscreen or <kbd>p</kbd> for presenter mode if you want to see my notes).
