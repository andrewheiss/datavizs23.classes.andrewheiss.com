### Possible questions to reflect on

::: {.callout-warning}
#### This is not a required list!

Remember, you don't need to answer all of these—or even any of them! These are just here to help guide your thinking. **Write about whatever you want.**
:::

- Why are stories so powerful?
- How are stories related to truth?
- Is it ethical to emphasize certain aspects of the facts in data more than others? How do you decide which facts to use to convince audiences?
- When you're telling a story about data, you're inherently manipulating audience emotions. Is that okay?
