### Possible questions to reflect on

::: {.callout-warning}
#### This is not a required list!

Remember, you don't need to answer all of these—or even any of them! These are just here to help guide your thinking. **Write about whatever you want.**
:::

- How can you correctly and honestly communicate relationships between variables? How can you communicate the uncertainty in those relationships?
- What are the dangers of visualizing two variables?
- When is it appropriate to use two y-axes?


## Slides

The slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
slide_buttons("/slides/07-slides")

xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  "/slides/07-slides.html",
  ratio = "16:9",
  border = "none",
  margin = "0 auto"
)
```

:::{.callout-tip}
**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.
