## Readings

- {{< fa book >}} [Chapter 9](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/boxplots-violins.html) in *Fundamentals of Data Visualization* [@Wilke:2018]
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Mike Bostock, ["Methods of Comparison, Compared"](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/methods-of-comparison-compared). Explanation of the differences between showing relative differences, absolute differences, and log ratios.
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [Sparkline theory and practice](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR). This is a collection of posts by Edward Tufte about sparklines—scroll down a ways and check out his examples, analysis, and critiques.
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [Time series sparklines](https://flowingdata.com/2017/01/24/one-dataset-visualized-25-ways/02-time-series-sparklines-2/)
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [Comparisons with lollipop charts](https://uc-r.github.io/lollipop). If you're feeling adventurous (and you should!), do this tutorial as you read it.

### Reproducible examples

Reprexes (or reproducible examples) are the best way to (1) get help online and (2) fix issues on your own. 

Making a good reprex is tricky, but it's a very valuable skill to know (regardless of programming language!). Here are some helpful resources for making them:

- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [What's a reproducible example (`reprex`) and how do I do one?](https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-whats-a-reproducible-example-reprex-and-how-do-i-do-one/5219)
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} [So you've been asked to make a reprex](https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/so-you-ve-been-asked-to-make-a-reprex/)
- {{< fa brands r-project >}} [The reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/index.html)

### Possible questions to reflect on

::: {.callout-warning}
#### This is not a required list!

Remember, you don't need to answer all of these—or even any of them! These are just here to help guide your thinking. **Write about whatever you want.**
:::

- These readings all show a ton of new ways to present comparisons. Which ones are your favorite? Which ones didn't quite click with you? In what situations are some more appropriate than others?


## Slides

The slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
slide_buttons("/slides/08-slides")

xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  "/slides/08-slides.html",
  ratio = "16:9",
  border = "none",
  margin = "0 auto"
)
```

:::{.callout-tip}
**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.
