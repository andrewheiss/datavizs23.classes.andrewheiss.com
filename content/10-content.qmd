## Readings

### Explorable explanations

- {{< fa trophy >}} Marcel Salathé and Nicky Case, ["What Happens Next: COVID-19 Futures, Explained with Playable Situations"](https://ncase.me/covid-19/)
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Brett Victor, ["Explorable Explanations"](http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/)
- {{< fa trophy >}} Look at [some of the explorable explorations here](https://explorabl.es/)
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Dragicevic, Jansen, Sarma, Kay, and Chevalier, ["Explorable Multiverse Analyses"](https://explorablemultiverse.github.io/). Use Chrome, open Example 1, scroll to page 2, and click on some of the blue text to change the results of the paper *within the paper itself*. This is magical. R Markdown can't quite get *this* interactive in real-time, but you can knit different versions of a document with slightly different parameters and options.

### Dashboards

- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Look at [some of these examples of Shiny apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Stephanie Evergreen, ["How a Dashboard Changes the Conversation"](https://stephanieevergreen.com/dashboard-conversation/)
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Stephanie Evergreen, ["The Problem with Dashboards (and a Solution)"](https://stephanieevergreen.com/problem-with-dashboards/)
- {{< fa arrow-up-right-from-square >}} Stephen Few, ["2012 Perceptual Edge Dashboard Design Competition: A Solution of My Own"](https://www.stephen-few.com/blog/2013/01/08/2012-perceptual-edge-dashboard-design-competition-a-solution-of-my-own/)
- {{< fa file-pdf >}} Skim through Stephen Few's [presentation on Information Dashboard Design](http://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/i247s12/files/2012/01/Dashboard-Design-Overview-Presentation.pdf)
- {{< fa brands google >}} Google "dashboard design" and skim through some of the thousands of articles about what makes a good (and bad) dashboard

### Possible questions to reflect on

::: {.callout-warning}
#### This is not a required list!

Remember, you don't need to answer all of these—or even any of them! These are just here to help guide your thinking. **Write about whatever you want.**
:::

- How helpful (or unhelpful) are explorable explanations?
- Have you seen examples of good dashboards before this class? Bad dashboards? What makes them good or bad?


## Slides

The slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
slide_buttons("/slides/10-slides")

xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  "/slides/10-slides.html",
  ratio = "16:9",
  border = "none",
  margin = "0 auto"
)
```

:::{.callout-tip}
**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.
