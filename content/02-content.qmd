- {{< fa file-pdf >}} [Summary of CRAP graphic design principles](http://www.presentationzen.com/chapter6_spread.pdf) from *Presentation Zen* [@Reynolds:2008]. These principles are from Robin Williams' [*The Non-Designer's Design & Type Books*](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-4th/dp/0133966151) [@Williams:2008], which you should really get if you're interested in doing anything design-related ever.

The rest of the *Practical Typography* book is phenomenal and you'd be remiss if you didn't read the whole thing and bookmark it for life, but for now just read this quick summary.

:::

- Why does graphic design matter when conveying truth?
- What makes something well designed (vs. poorly designed)?
