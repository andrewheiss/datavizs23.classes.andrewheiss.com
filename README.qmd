## How to build the site

1. Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) version 2022.07.1 or later since it has a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) installation embedded in it. Otherwise, download and install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) separately.
2. Open `datavizs23.Rproj` to open an [RStudio Project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html).
3. If it's not installed already, R *should* try to install the [{renv} package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) when you open the RStudio Project for the first time. If you don't see a message about package installation, install it yourself by running `install.packages("renv")` in the R console.
4. Run `renv::restore()` in the R console to install all the required packages for this project.
5. Run `targets::tar_make()` in the R console to build everything.
6. `r emoji::emoji("tada")` All done! `r emoji::emoji("tada")` The complete website will be in a folder named `_site/`.


## {targets} pipeline

I use the [{targets} package](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) to build this site and all its supporting files. The complete pipeline is defined in [`_targets.R`](_targets.R) and can be run in the R console with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
targets::tar_make()
```

The pipeline does several major tasks:

- **Build Quarto website**: This project is a [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), which compiles and stitches together all the `.qmd` files in this project based on the settings in [`_quarto.yml`](_quarto.yml). See the [Quarto website documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) for more details.

- **Upload resulting `_site/` folder to my remote server**: Quarto places the compiled website in a folder named `/_site/`. The pipeline uses `rsync` to upload this folder to my personal remote server. This target will only run if the `UPLOAD_WEBSITES` environment variable is set to `TRUE`, and it will only work if you have an SSH key set up on my personal server, which only I do.

The complete pipeline looks like this:

<small>(This uses [`mermaid.js` syntax](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) and should display as a graph on GitHub. You can also view it by pasting the code into <https://mermaid.live>.)</small>

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
# Make sure there are newlines between the code block boundaries and the output
# from `workflow`, which also needs to be separated by newlines
cat("``` mermaid\n")
cat(workflow_graph, sep = "\n")
cat("\n```")
```


## Fonts and colors

The fonts used throughout the site are [Fira Sans Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans+Condensed) and [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow).

The colors for the site and hex logo come from the [plasma](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html#the-color-scales) color scale from the viridis color maps:

```r
viridisLite::viridis(8, option = "plasma", begin = 0.1, end = 0.9)
```

```{r show-plasma, fig.width=8, fig.height=1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

pal_plasma <- viridisLite::viridis(8, option = "plasma", begin = 0.1, end = 0.9) %>% 
  # Remove the trailing transparency "FF" from the hex codes
  str_sub(end = -3)

tibble(
  x = 1:length(pal_plasma),
  color = pal_plasma
) %>%
  mutate(x_nice = glue::glue("[{x}]")) %>%
  mutate(across(c(color, x_nice), ~ fct_inorder(.))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = color, y = 1, fill = color)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_fill_identity() +
  facet_wrap(vars(x_nice), scales = "free_x", nrow = 1) +
  theme_void(base_family = "Inconsolata") +
  theme(
    panel.spacing.x = unit(-1, units = "pt"),
    panel.spacing.y = unit(-0.5, units = "lines"),
    strip.text = element_blank()
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(b = 5)))
```
