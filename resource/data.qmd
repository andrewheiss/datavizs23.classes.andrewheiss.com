There are a ton of places to find data related to public policy and administration (as well as data on pretty much any topic you want) online:

- [**Data is Plural newsletter**](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural): Jeremy Singer-Vine sends a weekly newsletter of the most interesting public datasets he's found. You should subscribe to it. [He also has an archive of all the datasets he's highlighted.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0)

- [**Google Dataset Search**](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch): Google indexes thousands of public datasets; search for them here.

- [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Kaggle hosts machine learning competitions where people compete to create the fastest, most efficient, most predictive algorithms. A byproduct of these competitions is a host of fascinating datasets that are generally free and open to the public. See, for example, [the European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer), the [Salem Witchcraft Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/salem-witchcraft-dataset) or results from an [Oreo flavors taste test](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/oreo-flavors-tastetest-ratings).

- [**360Giving**](http://www.threesixtygiving.org/data/data-registry/): Dozens of British foundations follow a standard file format for sharing grant data and have made that data available online.

- [**US City Open Data Census**](http://us-cities.survey.okfn.org/): More than 100 US cities have committed to sharing dozens of types of data, including data about crime, budgets, campaign finance, lobbying, transit, and zoning. This site from the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/) and [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org//) collects this data and rates cities by how well they're doing.

- **Political science and economics datasets**: There's a wealth of data available for political science- and economics-related topics:
    - [**Fran√ßois Briatte's extensive curated lists**](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/wiki/Data): Includes data from/about intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), public opinion surveys, parliaments and legislatures, wars, human rights, elections, and municipalities.
    - [**Thomas Leeper's list of political science datasets**](https://github.com/leeper/poliscitoys/issues/1): Good short list of useful datasets, divided by type of data (country-level data, survey data, social media data, event data, text data, etc.).
    - [**Erik Gahner's list of political science datasets**](https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData): Huge list of useful datasets, divided by topic (governance, elections, policy, political elites, etc.)
